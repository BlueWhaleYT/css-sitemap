# css-sitemap
CSS stylesheet for generating a visual sitemap inspired by [SlickMap](https://github.com/astuteo/slickmap)

## TODO
- [ ] Make responsive?
- [ ] Add fontawesome (or alternative) icon support
- [ ] Add style for a "multi-node" such as where a node represents a bunch of pages
- [ ] Create colour styles configurable by type, not just level
